README:
We are using "cthreadpool" (multi-threading code) that was developed by "Tomer Heber (heber.tomer@gmail.com)".
"cthreadpool" was downloaded from web where it was freely available. Files under "cthreadpool" did not contain
any copyright, so we are using it here and distributing with our code basically multi-threaded
memcached_client and memcached_client_write. However, we have slighlty modified the code to suit our
requirements.

====================================================================================

Use following commands to build threadpool:

rm *.o

rm example

gcc -c example.c; gcc -c threadpool.c; gcc -o example example.o threadpool.o -lpthread
